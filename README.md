### A cross-platform application built using Flutter to calculate stream-specific GPA.

As of now, this application is specifically targetted to Junior Year students of JNTUH of those who are enrolled in the R18 Regulation.

I have also developed a [RESTful API](https://github.com/hemanth-kotagiri/sgpa-rest-api) for this application
with which, results of all regular semesters of Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior can be fetched.

### Upcoming Features

More features to this application are on their way, some of them are :

- Database integration - Ability to store the results that have already been fetched/calculated.
- Supplementary results.
